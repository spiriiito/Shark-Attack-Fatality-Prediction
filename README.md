# Shark-Attack-Fatality-Prediction
This project uses real-world shark attack data to predict whether an incident is likely to be fatal or non-fatal, based on various features such as location, activity, time, and victim profile. It demonstrates the full data mining pipeline using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, F1 scores and etc
- Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook

## Launching the project:

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shark-attack-fatality-prediction.git
cd shark-attack-fatality-prediction
```

### 2. Install dependencies

To run the project, install these dependencies:
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- imblearn  
- xgboost

You can install them with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imblearn xgboost
```

### 3. Open the notebook

```bash
